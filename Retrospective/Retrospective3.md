- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  3,27 3,20
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total (hours estimation / sum of total hours spent) - 1
  72/70.6 - 1 = 2%

  - Nr of automated unit test cases  16
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated  
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated  15h
  - Total hours spent  12h
- Technical Debt management:

  - Total hours spent  15h 20m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube 15h
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues  // TO complete
  - Hours spent on remediation  // To complete
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability") 0.8%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )
    Reliability: A
    Security: A
    Maintainability: A
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - The number of hours per task is higher due to meeting and bug fix but the estimation is not affected and total estimatation error remains low.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Better communication of backend and frontend is needed in terms of task planning.
  - Plan the time for better technical debt management.
  - Number of people that needs to work on frontend should increase.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - Code review time is increased significantly.
  - Better work hours's management in terms of spent time is closer to the estimated time.  
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - We managed to achieve the goals we set on the preivous sprint.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Better management of technical debt.
  - Better coordination between frontend and backend.
  - Assigning more people or time to complete frontend tasks.


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We achieved a working solution.
