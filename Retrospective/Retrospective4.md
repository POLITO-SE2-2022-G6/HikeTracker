### Detailed statistics

| Story   | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_    |    11   |   -    |     54     |     46      |
| _#17_   |    5    |   5    |     9      |     6       |

| _#31_   |    2    |   1    |     0.75   |     0.25    |

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  Est: 3,6 3,7
  Act: 3 3,5
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total (hours estimation / sum of total hours spent) - 1
  72/63 - 1 = 24,28%

  - Total hours spent  11h
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube 9h 16m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues 9h
  - Hours spent on remediation  6h
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability") 0.0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )
    - Reliability: A
    - Security: A
    - Maintainability: A
  

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - We underestimated the difficult context that festivities represent

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - It is hard to realistically estimate the work to do during festivities
  - Don't underestimate the time spent for fixing bugs and code smells
  - When we focused on something we achieved it faster than expected

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - Less code smells and bugs  
  - Better coordination between frontend and backend
  - Focused more on frontend
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - Better management of technical debt. Because some of the code smells are not easy to fix and finding solutions took a lot of time.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Better time management
  - Better subdivision of tasks

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself
